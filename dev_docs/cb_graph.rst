Callback Graph

The CB graph is a networkx multidigraph.
The graph vertices are refered to as "actions", to distinguish them from ROS nodes.
In networkx, vertices have arbitrary hashable type and mutable attributes.
Here, the hashable type is an increasing, unique, integer ID which is generated by (TODO: function).
Every vertex has exactly one attribute with name "data", which is of type ``Action``.

Edges in networkx have no value, but every edge in the CB graph have an attribute to distinguish its type:
Every edge has an attribute "TODO: edge type name" of type "TODO: edge type enum"

Graph Processing
================

"Processing" refers to iterating over the graph and executing actions if possible.
Actions are able to be executed if their state is ``Ready`` (implying the required input is available/has been buffered) and if they have no outgoing edges (ordering dependencies).
Processing is done exhaustively, meaning that the graph is repeatedly iterated over until no action has been executed within one iteration.
