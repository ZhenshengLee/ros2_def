JSON Launch Configuration
=========================

The launch configuration must be described statically in a JSON file.
The file must adhere to the following schema (which is available at `launch_config_schema.json <https://github.com/uulm-mrm/ros2_def/blob/develop/ros2/orchestrator/schemas/launch_config_schema.json>`_ for IDE integration):

.. jsonschema:: ../../ros2/orchestrator/schemas/launch_config_schema.json
