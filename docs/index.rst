.. Orchestrator documentation master file

Welcome to the ROS 2 DEF documentation!
========================================

This is the Deterministic Execution Framework for ROS 2.
It allows fully deterministic execution of a ROS 2 stack, given deterministic ROS nodes.
The :ref:`user-docs` are intended for users who wish to integrate this into their own ROS 2 stack.
The :ref:`developer-docs` serve as a reference for the implementation of the framework and the orchestrator itself.

In :ref:`Thesis<thesis>`, the contents of the master's thesis can be found, in which this framework was initially created.
For a description of the problem of nondeterminism in ROS 2 stacks, see :ref:`sec-impl-problem_description` and following.
The scope of this framework is outlined in :ref:`sec-impl-design_goals`.
